        <h3>Changes to the website</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        We have 5 html pages. There were many required changes to be made to the CSS files and the javascript files.
        These changes are summarized below.
      </p>

      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>hovedside.html
          <ul>
            <li> For userfriendliness purposes, we decided to make the size of the slideshow images to be relative to
              the
              screen
              size instead of having a constant width of 800px and a height of 400px. Therefore we changed so that the
              slideshow’s width has the same width as the browser’s. We then changed the pictures for “Se meny”,
              “Catering
              & Events”, and “Kontakt Oss” as well as the width of the pictures from 200px to 300px. We also implemented
              a
              white border around each of the three images. The reason behind
              this change was that we needed to have pictures which was
              more suitable for the text links under each picture. Another change on the hovedsiden.html was that we
              created a gray box with a white border around “Hvem er Grab Your Box?” description. The reason
              behind this change
              was to make the content more align with the page's goal of informing the users about Grab Your Box'
              purpose
              and pakistani cuisine with highligting relevant information for fronting that goal. We mean that
              this change will make the text
              more simple and easy to read
              for the user of the webpage. Further we changed the “underline” style text for the links: “Se meny”,
              “Catering
              &
              Events”, and “Kontakt Oss”. Another implementation was that we changed the position
              of the slideshow
              so that is its parallel to the navigation bar's bottom with no space between the banner and the slideshow.
              This is for responsiveness
              purposes, to have identical
              positioning when the page crops in. We also think that this change will make the website more appealing to
              new
              customers which is
              align with one of
              the goals of the webpage. We implemented an overlay logo onto each slideshow' picture. The description
              under
              "Hvem er Grab Your Box?" was changed to Norwegian
              language.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li> meny.html
          <ul>
            <li> We removed the background-color behind the header and the content on the page after a talk with the
              client where she
              meant that it
              was
              more convenient with fever boxes on the menu page.
              Thereafter we removed the background-color on the box
              to contrast the
              background for better user experience. Added so a white horisontal borderline below "MENY" to clearly
              seperate the
              headline from the menu and make it easier to read the content for the user. We also chose to have the
              price
              before the food description because we feel users are
              most interested in the price,
              and based on that consider reading further about the food. For the heading for each dish in the menu we
              have
              changed the font size from 35pt to 30pt, a change from the ordinary font size for headings we have chosen.
              The reason for this change is to make the menu more visually appealing and to fit better.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> catering_events.html
          <ul>
            <li>
              We changed the position and size of the box to "send" on
              the left and "nullstill" to the
              right at the bottom of the page. Further we changed the text above the input "Har du noen andre
              kommentarer"
              to "Annen
              informasjon". In addition, we have also changed the design behind the form to be longer in height and
              smaller in width. The dish names also has a smaller font size, 11 pt.
              The reason behind these change is to make it more appealing to new customers to use the page.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li> faq.html
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li> First of all, we decided to change the file name from "faq.html" to "Ofte_Stilte_sporsmal.html" and
              changed the header from "FAQ" to "Ofte stilte spørsmål".
              Further, we decided not to divide the questions into two sections: About the food, and technical questions
              after a talk with the client where she suggested to make that change. Changed the background-color for the
              questions to hex: #383838 for Ofte_stilte_spørsmål.html
              page. Also, we choose to go for a background-color for the answers to Wild Sand, hex code: #f4f4f4
              and plain text color black for the answer text. Lastly, we set a black background-color over each button
              when clicked on. We also made the background smaller and reduced the margin and size of the background.
              All
              these changed was made for making it more convinent for the user of the webpage to get easily the
              information the customer is searching for. We put icons in the "Ofte_stilte_spørsmål.html" through the
              file Ofte_stilte_spørsmål.css, a (+) icon to open the answer and (-) icon to hide the answer when the
              question is clicked upon. We aligned the Icons with the button text. We aligned the Icons with the button
              text. We added a black hover style for each button inside
              the CSS file style_Ofte_stilte_spørsmål
              to Ofte_stilte_spørsmål.html for better
              user experience of
              the page.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li> kontakt_oss.html
          <ul>
            <li> The form used on this page originally had input fields placed next to each other. However, we decided
              after conversations with our client, Iqra Majeed, to make the form even more simplified by placing the
              input
              fields
              underneath each other. This creates a more natural approach to filling in the form by starting at the top
              and working downwards. To ease the process even more we decided to add a reset button next to the submit
              button
              that removes any information put in the input fields. We used the same size of the buttons as in
              catering_events.html. Apart from this,
              changes have been made to the navigation bar and footer as described down below </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>


      <ul>
        <li> Changes with intended CSS styling which applies to all html pages
          <ul>
            <li>
              Hovering: Another hovering we implemented was for all of the links except the instagram-icon on the
              footer,
              here we implemented a gray hover color. That means we implemented it for the navbar text links and the
              logo
              of Grab Your Box at the navbar and the links "Se meny", "catering & Events" and "kontakt oss" at
              hovedsiden.html. We also implemented a hovering for the triggered hamburger menu text with a font size
              increase from 20pt which is the navigational size we choose in P2 to 35pt when hovering. The reason why we
              implemented
              all of the hovering is
              for better user experience, to help the user to easier navigate on the page.
            </li>

            <li>
              Responsive web design and mobile version: We have chosen to make the website applicable for mobile as well
              as PC. We did this by using
              techniques such as CSS flexbox, use of percentages and media
              inquieres. The reason behind this change is for adapting
              different user experience for mobile as well as PC.
            </li>

            <li>
              Navbar position and its appearance: First of all, we changed the navbar text from "FAQ" to "Ofte stilte
              spørsmål" on the navbar. We also changed the height of the navbar to 100px instead of 200px for visual
              reasons, we reasoned with the client that it was too much with 200px. We also used text align to center
              the
              navbar text and changed the text size from 20pt to 15pt for the navbar text because 20pt was too big.
            </li>

            <li>
              Body height and width: We changed the web page width from 1980px. We made the height of each individual
              website so that it justifys the content on the
              page, and the width responsive so that when the website resizes, both larger and smaller, the content also
              shrinks/expands, instead of using a fixed webpage width.
            </li>

            <li>
              Links: We changed the logo in the banner to be a clickable link that will lead the user to the main page
              when clicked on.
            </li>

            <li>
              Rollover menu: First we changed the background color from hex: #383838 to hex: #282828 to separate the
              triggered rollover
              menu from the navbar. The hamburger menu icon only appears when the width of the screen is less than
              1207px. We have change the layout from the mockup in P2 so that the triggered rollovermenu will be visible
              from the right for PC and screen width bigger than 800px. For screens less than 800px the triggered
              hamburger menu will take up the full width of the screen. This is for responsivness purposes and to have a
              more suitable mobile version.
            </li>

            <li>
              Footer: First we changed the
              footer
              so that now it only shows “Grab Your Box © 2021” with an Instagram logo that opens to a new
              tab to GYB’s Instagram page when clicked on the icon. The text and the instagram-icon was set to be
              aligned
              at the
              center of each page. The reason why we
              changed the footer is because as per
              P1, the website should
              be “clean” and
              minimalised
              in term of appearance. With this in mind, we also decided to make the footer “float” and follow the
              scrolling of the
              website whilst staying at the bottom to make the website more appealing for users. We therefore
              decided it was no need to
              have a copy of the same links: "Se meny", "Bestill mat", "Catering & events" and "kontakt oss" in the
              footer
              when both the navigation bar and footer will follow the scrolling motion. As a risk of
              redudancy and confusing the user of the webpage, we therefore removed the links with the
              text from the footer. After at talk with
              the client we also removed the facebook icon because the client's facebook page was not going to be in
              use.
              The
              height of the footer was changed from 200px to 50px.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li> Additional file modularity.js
          <ul>
            <li> Trond created a javascript file for modularity for the footer and navbar on each page. The banner
              was included in the navbar modularity as well. Here we used the DOM and attached content to each page
              through javascript.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li> Additional file formValidation-cateringevents.js
          <ul>
            <li>
              Safura in collaboration with Wally created a javascript file for a alert window on the screen when the
              user
              fill out
              the necessary
              information on the page "catering & events".
              The reason behind this change is to inform the customer in appropriate way that we have received the
              information from the user,
              ie in formValdiation-cateringevents because of the ekstra content we had to make a form which also will
              give
              you a alert when a dish/checkbox is not clicked.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li> Additional file formValidation-kontaktoss.js
          <ul>
            <li>
              Safura in collaboration with Trond created a javascript file for a alert window on the screen when the
              user
              fill out
              the necessary
              information on the page "kontakt oss".
              The reason behind this change is to inform the customer in appropriate way that we have received the
              all of the information from the user.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li> Additional Javascript file bildefade.js
          <ul>
            <li> Simen in collaboration with Jan created a javascript file that provides a change in animation for the
              "hamburgermenu" icon when
              clicked
              on and triggered for making the website more dynamic and appealing for the user of the website.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li> Modularity Requirement
          <ul>
            <li> We created a Javascript file containing two "divs" for modularity for each page. The first one named
              "navbar"
              for handling the
              navbar layout, and another one named "footer" for the footer layout. Both where set as an empty div with
              ID
              "navbar" and ID "footer in each HTML file. The reason why we have chosen this
              modularity method is because it makes it easy to
              maintain and structure the code on each page. Trond was responsible for the implementation of the
              modularity. </li>
